Introduction
Delinquency is a situation that arises when an activity or situation does not occur at its scheduled (or expected) time.

Many donors, experts, and microfinance institutions (MFI) have become convinced that using mobile financial services (MFS) is more convenient and efficient, and less costly, than the traditional high-touch model for delivering microfinance services.

MFS becomes especially useful when targeting the unbanked poor living in remote areas.

The implementation of MFS, though, has been uneven with both significant challenges and successes.

Today, microfinance is widely accepted as a poverty-reduction tool, representing $70 billion in outstanding loans and a global outreach of 200 million clients.
